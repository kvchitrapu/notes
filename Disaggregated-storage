# Building an elastic query engine on disaggregated storage
Source: https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/03/09/snowflake/

Cloud-native design principles:
1. scalability of independent resources  - disaggregation to allow resources to scale independently based on pre-determined resourcec units
2. elasticity with declarable units - quantamize resources to allow expand or contract resources in those unit steps.
3. multi-tenancy with isolation

Current trends:
1. Variety of data sources to support is ever increasing.
2. Most workloads vary in system resource (cpu, mem, i/o) demands based on traffic

Data processing guidelines:
1. decouple compute and storage resource management
2. an emphemeral storage for transient usecases like number crunching, union of results/queries, caching
3. isolation of storage and compute for workloads

Observations:
1. ...
